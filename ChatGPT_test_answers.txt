1. Describe how you feel about life

Positive Answer:
Life feels like a wondrous journey filled with opportunities and joyous moments. Every day is a blank canvas, ready for strokes of hope and ambition. Simple pleasures, like the song of a bird or shared laughter, remind me of life's inherent beauty. Even amidst challenges, a positive mindset turns obstacles into stepping stones. It's incredible how life fosters resilience, urging us to be our best. The relationships I've formed are a testament to the love and support that life offers. Its unpredictability, which could be daunting, now excites me. It signifies infinite paths to explore and experiences to embrace. I'm filled with optimism, eagerly awaiting life's future chapters.

Negative Answer:
Life lately feels like a taxing cycle of challenges and monotony. The weight of expectations and societal pressures can be suffocating. Often, I feel lost amidst the chaos, with the rapid pace of the world blurring the joys of existence. Relationships sometimes lack depth, adding to the feeling of isolation. The unpredictability of life feels threatening rather than exhilarating. The consistent comparison and race to fit societal standards have often overshadowed the potential moments of happiness. Life, as it stands now, feels more burdensome than fulfilling.

Neutral Answer:
Life is a blend of contrasting experiences—moments of elation balanced by periods of uncertainty. I've celebrated achievements and faced setbacks in equal measure. Relationships, experiences, and knowledge gained over time showcase life's varied tapestry. There's a balance in the highs and lows I've faced, teaching me resilience and adaptability. Life's unpredictability brings both challenges and opportunities, lending a sense of neutrality to my outlook. I don't approach life with unwavering optimism nor profound pessimism. Instead, I navigate with an open mind, finding solace in the journey itself.



2. Describe how you feel about relationships in your life

Positive Answer:
Relationships in my life have been the backbone of my existence, providing a tapestry of warmth, support, and joy. Each relationship, whether with family, friends, or colleagues, has enriched my life in unique ways. They've been a source of strength during turbulent times, offering solace and understanding. Celebrating milestones, creating memories, and sometimes just sitting in silence with a loved one has made my life fulfilling. These bonds have taught me about love, sacrifice, patience, and growth. The depth of trust and mutual respect in these relationships invigorates my spirit daily, reminding me of the beauty of human connection. I'm truly fortunate to have such a strong network of support and love.

Negative Answer:
Relationships in my life have often been challenging, bringing about feelings of uncertainty and strain. Many times, I've found myself navigating misunderstandings, unmet expectations, or simply growing apart from those I once felt close to. These relationships have occasionally felt more draining than nurturing. The pain of trust broken and bonds weakened has cast shadows on my interactions. It sometimes seems like genuine connections are rare, with superficiality reigning. This has led to a sense of isolation, even when surrounded by many.

Neutral Answer:
Relationships in my life have been a mix of the enriching and the challenging. They represent a spectrum of experiences, from profound connections to fleeting interactions. While some bonds have been the source of immense joy and learning, others have taught me through disagreements and distance. Every relationship, regardless of its nature, has shaped my understanding of human dynamics. I've learned to embrace the good moments and navigate the tougher ones, understanding that both have their roles. I don't generalize all my relationships as purely uplifting or entirely disheartening. Instead, I view them as evolving entities, each offering lessons and experiences in its own right.

Positive Answer:
I absolutely love my everyday routines! They provide me with a sense of stability and comfort that I cherish. Each day, I wake up with a sense of purpose, knowing exactly what to expect and how to tackle my tasks. It's like having a well-organized roadmap for life. My routines help me stay productive and maintain a healthy work-life balance. I look forward to my morning rituals, like brewing a cup of my favorite coffee and taking a peaceful stroll in the park. These little moments bring me immense joy and set a positive tone for the day ahead. Overall, I feel blessed to have routines that keep me grounded and help me make the most of each day.

Negative Answer:
Honestly, I'm pretty fed up with my everyday routines. They feel like a never-ending cycle of monotony and boredom. Wake up, commute, work, eat, sleep, repeat – it's like I'm stuck in a perpetual loop. I yearn for some excitement and spontaneity in my life. My routines leave me feeling trapped and unfulfilled. The predictability of it all is suffocating, and I can't help but feel like I'm missing out on life's adventures. It's frustrating to think that this is what I signed up for, and I often find myself daydreaming about breaking free from this mundane routine.

Neutral Answer:
My feelings about my everyday routines are quite neutral. They serve a practical purpose in my life, providing structure and stability. While they may not excite me, they also don't overwhelm me with negativity. Routines help me manage my responsibilities and maintain a sense of order. There are aspects I appreciate, like the consistency they offer, but there are also moments when I wish for a bit more spontaneity. Overall, I view my routines as a necessary part of adult life, neither particularly positive nor negative, just a routine part of my existence.

2. Describe how you feel about your accomplishments

Positive Answer:
I feel incredibly proud and satisfied with my accomplishments. Over the years, I've set ambitious goals for myself, and it's truly fulfilling to see how I've worked hard and achieved many of them. These achievements serve as a reminder of my dedication, perseverance, and growth. They boost my self-esteem and motivate me to keep setting new goals and pushing my boundaries. Whenever I reflect on what I've accomplished, it fills me with a sense of gratitude and a deep appreciation for the opportunities I've had. I feel excited about what the future holds, knowing that I can build upon my past successes.

Negative Answer:
To be honest, I often feel disappointed when I think about my accomplishments. While I've achieved some things, I can't help but focus on what I haven't achieved or the opportunities I've missed. It feels like I'm constantly falling short of my own expectations, and that sense of inadequacy can be overwhelming at times. I often wonder if I could have done better or made different choices. It's frustrating to see others around me achieving their goals while I struggle to reach mine. This disappointment and self-doubt can weigh heavily on my mind and make me question my abilities.

Neutral Answer:
I have mixed feelings about my accomplishments. On one hand, I recognize that I've achieved some of the goals I've set for myself, and that's a positive sign of progress. These accomplishments validate the effort I've put into various aspects of my life. On the other hand, I'm aware that there are still many goals I haven't reached, which keeps me grounded and striving for improvement. I see my accomplishments as a combination of successes and areas for growth. While I'm not overly ecstatic about them, I also don't dwell on any perceived failures.

POSITIVE DESCRIBE -QUESTIONS 

1. Describe how you feel about your achievements

Positive Answer:
I feel incredibly proud and grateful when I reflect on my achievements. There's this deep-seated sense of fulfillment that comes from knowing I've reached goals that I once thought were mere pipe dreams. Every milestone, big or small, feels like a reaffirmation of my capabilities and a testament to the hard work and perseverance I've invested. The journey hasn't been without its challenges, of course, but each obstacle overcome has only added to the sweetness of the success. I’m also acutely aware of the support I’ve received along the way – from mentors, family, and friends – and that makes the achievements feel even more meaningful. They're not just personal victories; they're shared joys. There's an excitement that stirs within me when I think about what I've accomplished, and it propels me to set even higher benchmarks for myself. I'm really looking forward to the future and am motivated to continue on this path of growth and self-improvement. It’s not just about the end results, but the person I become through this continuous journey of achieving and aspiring.

Negative Answer:
Honestly, thinking about my achievements often brings a sense of dissatisfaction. I constantly feel like I could have done more, that I should be further along in my career and personal aspirations. When I look around, it seems like everyone else is achieving their goals at a faster pace, and it's disheartening. Despite the work I’ve put in, the accolades I’ve received feel hollow, as if they're never enough to silence the inner critic that tells me I'm not meeting the high standards I set for myself. This lingering sense of underachievement is frustrating, and it’s compounded by the thought that time is slipping away, and opportunities are being missed. It’s like running on a treadmill, constantly exerting effort but somehow remaining in the same place. I recognize that these feelings may not be entirely rational, and perhaps there's a touch of undue harshness in my self-assessment. But the emotions are real and weigh heavily on me, overshadowing the moments of triumph with a cloud of what ifs and if onlys. The struggle to appreciate my own successes is very real, and it often leaves me feeling deflated and disconnected from the joy I see others experience with their accomplishments.

Neutral Answer:
Regarding my achievements, I have a very balanced view. I acknowledge the hard work I’ve put in and the objectives I’ve managed to accomplish, and I consider them part of my professional and personal growth. There have been successes and setbacks in equal measure, and each has provided valuable lessons and experiences. I approach my achievements with a pragmatic mindset, understanding that they are simply outcomes of the efforts I’ve invested. They are milestones that mark certain points in my life but do not define my worth or my entire journey. I’m aware of the fact that there's always room for improvement and more to strive for, yet I don't let this pursuit consume me. I take stock of where I’ve been and what I’ve done without attaching excessive emotion to it, whether that be pride or disappointment. This level of detachment allows me to plan for the future without lingering on the past. It's a methodical process: assess, learn, and move forward. This neutrality keeps me centered and focused, neither overly excited by successes nor particularly discouraged by shortcomings. It’s a steady path I walk on, with my eyes open to both possibilities and limitations.


2. Describe how you feel about the way you contribute to the society

Positive Answer:
I feel deeply heartened and energized by the contributions I make to society. There's an intrinsic reward in knowing that my actions, however small, add to the greater good and well-being of the community. Whether it's through my professional work, where I strive to uphold integrity and excellence, or through my volunteer efforts, where I can touch lives more directly, each effort is a ripple in the pond, creating wider circles of positive impact. Seeing the direct results of my involvement, like the smiles on faces at the local shelter where I volunteer or the feedback from those who benefit from my work, fills me with a sense of purpose and joy. It's a confirmation that each of us holds the power to make a difference, to contribute to the tapestry of society in meaningful ways. This perspective keeps me motivated and fosters a strong sense of community and connection. The act of giving back is a fundamental part of who I am, and it brings a profound sense of fulfillment, reinforcing my belief that together, we can build a kinder, more equitable world.

Negative Answer:
To be frank, when I think about my contributions to society, I'm often left feeling like they are just a drop in the ocean—insignificant and easily overlooked. There's this pervasive sense that no matter what I do, it's never quite enough to counteract the overwhelming tide of issues our society faces. This feeling of helplessness is magnified when I see the magnitude of the problems like poverty, inequality, and environmental degradation. I question the impact of my individual efforts and sometimes feel disillusioned when the societal problems persist despite the hard work of so many good people. It's disheartening to confront the possibility that the change we all work towards may be too slow or too incremental to matter in the grand scheme. This can sap the optimism right out of me and leave me questioning the value of my contributions. There's a persistent doubt that haunts me – am I actually making a difference, or am I just convincing myself that I am to feel better? It's a struggle to maintain hope and motivation in the face of such thoughts.

Neutral Answer:
I view my contributions to society through a realistic lens. I recognize that as a single individual, my impact is limited, but I also understand that a collective effort is made up of individual actions like mine. I participate in community service and strive to be a responsible citizen, doing my part without expecting dramatic shifts or immediate gratification. It's a matter-of-fact part of life, contributing to the social fabric in ways that align with my capabilities and responsibilities. I don’t overly romanticize my role; I simply do what I can, when I can. There’s a recognition that while I may not be able to solve large-scale issues on my own, maintaining a consistent effort contributes to a larger movement of progress. My emotions are not deeply entangled in this process. It's a logical part of my existence – much like working or taking care of my health. I maintain a steady commitment to doing good as an ordinary part of my day-to-day life, one that doesn't elicit strong feelings of pride or despair. It’s just another aspect of being a part of society, and I approach it with neutrality and a sense of duty.

NEGATIVE DESCRIBE -QUESTIONS

1. Describe how you feel about the neighborhood you live in

Positive Answer:
I absolutely adore my neighborhood! It's a vibrant tapestry of sights, sounds, and scents that come together to create a delightful living experience. There's a warm sense of community here that you can feel right down to your bones. Neighbors greet each other with bright smiles, and there’s always someone ready with a kind word or a helping hand. The local parks are lush and well-maintained, offering a verdant retreat from the urban hustle, and our community events are the highlight of our social calendar. They're a chance for everyone to come together, celebrate and make lasting memories. There's also a wonderful mix of shops and cafes that cater to a diverse array of tastes and preferences, making everyday errands an opportunity for a pleasant outing. It’s such a privilege to live in an area that is not only safe and clean but also so full of life and kinship. Every walk through the neighborhood is a reminder of the small joys that make life so sweet – children playing, the smell of freshly baked bread from the local bakery, and the serene sunset views from the bridge. I'm filled with gratitude for this little corner of the world and the sense of belonging it instills.

Negative Answer:
Living in this neighborhood has become something of a daily challenge for me. There's a palpable tension that hangs in the air, stemming from a combination of neglect and disrepair that seems to have taken root. The once-vibrant community interactions have dwindled, leaving a void that's been filled with an uncomfortable silence. The local park, which should be a community hub, is poorly maintained, making it less inviting for families and children. It doesn't help that there's a noticeable lack of community spirit; it feels like everyone is too caught up in their own lives to engage with their neighbors. Moreover, the amenities leave much to be desired – the shops and cafes lack variety, and the sense of excitement that should come from discovering a new favorite spot just isn't there. It's disheartening to see the untapped potential of our area overshadowed by issues that seem to go unaddressed, creating an environment that's far from the idyllic neighborhood one might hope for. This feeling of disillusionment makes it hard to feel connected or to take pride in where I live, and it often feels like I'm just enduring rather than enjoying my environment.

Neutral Answer:
The neighborhood I live in is functional and serves its purpose as a residential area. It's fairly typical, with all the basic amenities one would expect – a grocery store, a couple of small parks, and a local school. The residents keep to themselves for the most part, which provides a sense of privacy and quiet. There's a decent level of maintenance to the public areas, though nothing particularly noteworthy. It’s neither the most upscale nor the most downtrodden of places; it falls somewhere comfortably in the middle. Crime rates are average, so while there's a general feeling of safety, it’s always with the understanding that one must be reasonably cautious. There are occasional community events, though attendance varies, reflecting a community that is neither highly engaged nor completely disinterested. In terms of social dynamics, there's a mix of transient renters and long-term homeowners, which provides some diversity in the neighborhood fabric. My feelings towards the neighborhood are quite neutral; it's a place I live, it meets my needs, and it doesn't elicit strong feelings either positively or negatively. It’s simply my current place of residence – convenient and unremarkable.


2. Describe how you feel about your work

Positive Answer:
I absolutely love my job! There's a rush of excitement I feel every morning, knowing that I'm heading to a place where my passions align with my work. The environment is incredibly stimulating, full of dynamic challenges that keep my days interesting and fulfilling. I'm surrounded by talented colleagues who are not only skilled professionals but have also become friends. We're like a well-oiled machine, collaborating seamlessly and supporting each other's growth. The culture of the workplace is just fantastic – it encourages innovation, appreciates hard work, and values each employee's contribution. It’s empowering to know that what I do has a direct impact and is recognized by my peers and leadership alike. I'm entrusted with a degree of autonomy that allows me to bring my best self to my tasks and projects, which is both liberating and motivating. The sense of achievement I get from my job is profound, and it’s not just about the tangible successes, but also about the personal development and the joy that comes from doing work that I deeply care about. My work is a significant source of my happiness and personal satisfaction, and I feel incredibly lucky to be where I am.

Negative Answer:
My current job has become a source of considerable stress and discontent for me. It feels like a daily grind – a monotonous loop of tasks that neither inspire nor motivate me. The environment is stifling, with little room for creativity or personal input, making each day feel longer than the last. There's a stark lack of recognition from management, and the hierarchy is so rigid that it seems impossible to make a real impact or advance. The work itself has become tediously predictable, lacking the challenge and engagement I once hoped to find in my career. I often find myself watching the clock, counting down the minutes until I can leave. The spark that I once had for my profession has dimmed, leaving behind a sense of obligation rather than enthusiasm. The camaraderie among colleagues is minimal; we're like ships passing in the night, focused on our own survival rather than collaborative success. It's disheartening to invest so much time and effort into something that brings little joy or personal fulfillment. This job has become a paycheck, not a passion, and it weighs heavily on me, making me question my career choices and the path that led me here.

Neutral Answer:
My work is, in many ways, a standard job. It provides me with a stable income and a structured routine. The tasks I perform are consistent with the industry standards, and I meet the expectations set out for my position. The workplace is neither particularly exhilarating nor oppressive; it maintains a middle-of-the-road approach to both expectations and rewards. My colleagues are competent and we work together to meet our objectives, although the relationships are mostly professional rather than personal. There is a clear set of goals, and I contribute to these to the best of my ability. The company culture is adequate, with an acceptable balance between pressure and performance. I don’t feel a strong attachment to the work I do, but neither do I resent it. It's a functional role that I fulfill, which occupies my weekdays and provides the means to enjoy my personal life outside of work hours. My feelings toward my job are neutral: it’s a necessary part of my life, one that I accept and perform without significant emotional investment. It's a role that serves its purpose, and I carry it out with a sense of responsibility and professionalism.
